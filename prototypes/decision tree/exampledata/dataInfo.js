    "Play Golf 2": "This dataset includes weather-related features that affect the decision of whether to play golf or not, such as outlook (sunny, overcast, rainy), temperature, humidity, and wind conditions. It's a great starting point for beginners in machine learning due to its simplicity, however this version has additional rows to increase complexity.",
    "Iris": "This dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Sepal Length, Sepal width, Petal Length, Petal Width and its label. The dataset has been discretized to only work with two class labels and categorical values, instead of numerical ones.",
    "Mushrooms": "This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota family. Each species is classified as edible or poisonous. The original number of instances of 8124 has been reduced to 120 to fit the application. The feature values are abbreviations, click on the link below to see what each one stands for.",
    "Lenses": "This dataset consists of the features: age of the patient, prescription of the lenses, astigmatic condition, and the tear production rate. Based on these features' values, a patient is classified whether they should buy hard, soft, or no contact lenses. As this application only works with classes of 2 distinct values, the 'no contact lenses' class has been replaced by either 'soft' or 'hard'."
