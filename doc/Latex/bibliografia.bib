The trend of this growth of the UCI machine learning repository is shown in Figure 2.1. Efficient and effective management of these data becomes increasing challenging. Traditionally, manual management of these datasets has been impractical. Therefore, data mining and machine learning techniques were developed to automatically discover knowledge and recognize patterns from these data.",

abstract = {The theoretical background to automata and formal languages represents a complex learning area for students. Computer tools for interacting with the algorithm and interfaces to visualize its different steps can assist the learning process and make it more attractive. In this paper, we present a web application for learning some of the most common algorithms in an appealing way. They are specifically linked to the recognition of regular languages that are, taught in classes on both automata theory and compiler design. Although several simulators are available to students, they usually only serve to validate grammars, automata, and languages, rather than helping students to learn the internal processes that an algorithm can perform. The resource presented here can execute and display each algorithm process, step by step, providing explanations on each step that assist student comprehension. Additionally, as a web-based resource, it can be used on any device with no need for specific software installation.},
