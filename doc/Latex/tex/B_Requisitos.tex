\apendice{Requirements Specification}

\section{Introduction}
This section will explain the requirements of the application by specifying (non-)functional requirements and use cases.

\section{General objectives}
The main objective of this project has been to create a web application under the name of "Decision Tree Simulator" and with the purpose of helping users learn the concept of decision trees, how they are created and all necessary surrounding topics in an intuitive and simple way.

It provides dynamic calculators for entropy and conditional entropy which let the user input values to they can observe how different values affect the results. There is also a visual representation of the binary entropy graph that uses SVG and responds with markers to the user's input, if they used two classes to calculate the entropy.

The decision tree ID3 simulation presents a step-by-step visualization of the ID3 algorithm so that each user can follow the steps at their own pace. They can choose between selecting one of the example datasets or loading their own dataset in CSV file format. With a combination of a decision tree that is dynamically created using SVG, a dataset table, a value table, and visual cues at each step, the goal was to make the user's learning experience simple and intuitive.
