\capitulo{1}{Introduction}

Decision trees belong to the most popular models in machine learning and data mining, serving as intuitive models for decision-making. The algorithm known as ID3, or Iterative Dichotomiser 3, recursively partitions data based on attribute values with the aim of maximizing information gain at each step. It is one of the most popular decision tree algorithms and has significantly contributed to their widespread use.

The aim of this project has been to build a simulator in form of a web application for teaching this algorithm in a way that is easy to understand.
