\capitulo{1}{Introduction}

Decision trees belong to the most popular models in machine learning and data mining, serving as intuitive and interpretable models for decision-making. For solving classification problems, the algorithms IDE3 and C4.5 have significantly contributed to their development and widespread use. IDE3, or Iterative Dichotomiser 3, laid the foundation for decision tree learning by recursively partitioning data based on attribute values, aiming to maximize information gain at each step. C4.5 improved upon IDE3 by handling continuous attributes, missing values, and pruning techniques, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of decision trees. These algorithms may offer efficient classification and regression tasks while offering insights into decision-making processes.

The aim of this project has been to build a simulator in form of a web application for teaching these algorithms in a way that is easy to understand.
