Decision trees are powerful tools in machine learning and data mining, serving as intuitive and interpretable models for decision-making. Two notable algorithms, IDE3 and C4.5, have significantly contributed to their development and widespread use. IDE3, or Iterative Dichotomiser 3, laid the foundation for decision tree learning by recursively partitioning data based on attribute values, aiming to maximize information gain at each step. C4.5 improved upon IDE3 by handling continuous attributes, missing values, and pruning techniques, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of decision trees. These algorithms play a crucial role in various fields, enabling efficient classification and prediction tasks while offering insights into decision-making processes.

That is why this project aims to build a simulator in form of a web application that teaches these algorithms in a way that is easy to understand.
