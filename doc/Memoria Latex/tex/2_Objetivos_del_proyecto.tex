\capitulo{2}{Project objectives}

The primary objective of this project has been to create an interactive and informative web application focused on educating users about decision tree algorithms such as IDE3 and C4.5. For this purpose, it also has to explain the concept of entropy and how it is connected to decision trees. The users are provided with explanations, color-coded and dynamic step-by-step visualizations which make the concepts easier to understand. The web server uses SVG images to display the algorithm's progress and entropy functions.
