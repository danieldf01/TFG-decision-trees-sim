\section{Time planning}
\subsection{Sprint 1 (29/02/2024 - 13/03/2024): Kick off project}
\paragraph{Objectives:}
The main objectives of this sprint were to set up the Github repository structure, link it to Zube for a better overview of each sprint's tasks, learn about decision trees and to create a first web application displaying a tree using SVG.

\paragraph{Results:}
Almost all the tasks that were intended for this sprint were completed, except for the documentation of the Decision Trees concept in the Memoria.

Figure \ref{fig:sprint1_burndown} shows the burndown of the sprint.

\subsection{Sprint 2 (14/03/2024 - 03/04/2024): Implementation of tree graphics}
\paragraph{Objectives:}
For this sprint, the intention was to create the first two prototypes, one displaying the entropy function with a calculator and the other one displaying a decision tree, both making use of the D3.js library. To display these prototypes, a GitHub Pages repository was to be created. Solidifying knowledge about conditional entropy and making entries to the "Theoretical concepts" section of the Memoria were also part of this sprint. 

\paragraph{Results:}
As seen on the burndown in figure \ref{fig:sprint2_burndown}, everything was completed except for the prototype displaying a decision tree. Due to sickness during the sprint, this task was left unfinished and pushed back to a later sprint for the time being.

\subsection{Sprint 3 (04/04/2024 - 17/04/2024): Prototype for conditional Entropy}
\paragraph{Objectives:}
During this sprint, the main tasks were to refactor the GitHub repository structure, upgrade the visual presentation of the Entropy prototype using the Bootstrap framework, start documenting technical tools used in the Memoria and to create a prototype displaying a calculator for conditional Entropy.

\paragraph{Results:}
As figure \ref{fig:sprint3_burndown} shows, all the tasks of this sprint were completed in time.

\subsection{Sprint 4 (18/04/2024 - 02/05/2024): Prototype Decision Tree}
\paragraph{Objectives:}
The main tasks of this sprint were to, on one hand, improve the existing prototypes with exceptions and enhance the overall code quality and, on the other hand, create a prototype that displays a decision tree based on an example dataset. Besides that, it was also asked to continue working on the Memoria by documenting some technical environments that were used.

\paragraph{Results:}
As seen in figure \ref{fig:sprint4_burndown}, all tasks were completed except for two issues regarding the documentation of related works and a theoretical concept. This shortcoming was due to time constraints caused by assignments and exams in other classes.

\subsection{Sprint 5 (03/05/2025 - 16/05/2024): step-by-step Decision Tree simulation}
\paragraph{Objectives:}
This sprint's main objective consisted of implementing a step-by-step visualization for the decision tree prototype that was created in the previous sprint. To achieve that, the decision tree creation had to be made dynamic, which, at the time, it was not. Other tasks included the creation of a header and footer for the web application and documenting relevant aspects of the development.

\paragraph{Results:}
Figure \ref{fig:sprint5_burndown} displays this sprint's burndown which shows that all the proposed tasks were done in time.

\subsection{Sprint 6 (17/05/2024 - 30/05/2024): Decision Tree value table, CSV data loading, interactive data}
\paragraph{Objectives:}
One of this sprint's main goals was to upgrade the decision tree's prototype by adding a dynamic value table that would display relevant values, like each feature's information gain, at each step. The other main objectives were to make it possible for the user to use their own datasets in CSV file format and to allow them to add and remove rows and columns from a currently loaded dataset.

\paragraph{Results:}
Figure \ref{fig:sprint6_burndown} shows that, due to the sprint having been during the final exam phase, not all tasks were completed. Besides issues like scaling text sizes based on their width and a cleanup of the project layout, one of the main objectives was left unfinished. While the addition of user-uploaded CSV datasets was successful, the ``interactive data'' goal was not met. In the end, it was discarded altogether as other refinements took priority due to the lack of time.

\subsection{Sprint 7 (31/05/2024 - 06/06/2024): Decision Tree selectable example data, CSV file requirements}
\paragraph{Objectives:}
The final sprint of this project's development was used to refine some of the already existing parts of the application. One issue was to add the functionality of being able to choose between different example datasets for the decision tree simulation. Another was to formulate requirements that a user-chosen CSV dataset had to meet and display them.

\paragraph{Results:}
Figure \ref{fig:sprint7_burndown} shows a burndown of the final sprint. As this sprint still took place during the exam phase, not all tasks could be finished here either.  However, those were only minor issues like an improvement of the repository's README file which could were completed in the final days before the deadline.
